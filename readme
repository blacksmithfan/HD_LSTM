This code is a re-implementation of HD-LSTM based on TensorFlow

The code is tested on Mac OS Yosemite (CPU only) and Ubuntu 14.04 (Quadro K5000, cuda 7.5) with Python 2.7, and should be shortly working with Windows machines. Please refer to relevant resources for the installation of TensorFlow. If you are learning shape representations on a small dataset, such as McGill, a CPU-based version should be adquate. 

Please note that so far the published code is incomplete. A more complete version with a full demo file and more descriptions should soon be updated (most probably in late November). But the published code should be sufficient for learning robust 3D shape representations with LSTM.
